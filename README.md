# Starting With Java

My first Java project. **All code in `/src*` directory**/

### `/Src` structure
- *Input* -- some methods that help to save some lines of code while interacting with a user through the console
- *ArrayTools* -- my custom tools used to work with arrays
- *Search* -- Search algorythms (binary Search)
- *Sort* -- sorting algorythms (quick Sort, bubble Sort)
- *Run* -- main file, contains the `main` method
