# Starting With Java

My first Java project. **All code in `/src*` directory**/

### `/Src` structure
- *input* -- some methods that help to save some lines of code while interacting with a user through the console
- *arrayTools* -- my custom tools used to work with arrays
- *search* -- search algorythms (binary search)
- *sort* -- sorting algorythms (quick sort, bubble sort)
- *run* -- main file, contains the `main` method
